	    <p>Hello, my name is Patrick "Rippersmith" Smith.</p>
	    <p>I am a recent graduate from Sacred Heart University's
  	    Computer Science Undergraduate program, with my focus
            specifically on video game design and programming.</p>
	    <p>I personally have a dream to work on my own games one day,
	    and have tried to learn as much as I can in video games in order
	    to do so. I have studied game design, programming, pixel art and
	    3D modelling in order to better myslef.</p>
	    <p>This website exhibits some of my most notable work in
	    pixel art and animations, as well as some of the games
	    that I have made or are working on. If you are interested
	    in hiring me, my contact information is also here. I hope
	    that you enjoy what you see!</p>
